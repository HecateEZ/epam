everybody's going to the party
have a real good time
dancing in the desert
blowing up the sunshine

kneeling roses disappearing into
mose's dry mouth

everybody's going to the party
have a real good time
dancing in the desert
blowing up the sunshine

Hey man, look at me rockin' out
I'm on the radio
